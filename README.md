## Description

This purpose of this app is to creat a simulation of an restaurant menu and ordering system that the user can interact with through the terminal. The "customer" can view the menu, select items and quantities, and after indicating that they are finished ordering, the program will "print out" a receipt for them to view their order summary.

Through this app, I got to practice basic concepts with Python, like string manipulation, iterating through lists and dictionaries, and interacting with a user through the terminal.

## Installation

Copy the SSH Key from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dcartolano/hungry-hungry-python) and perform a git clone into a local directory of your choice. Open in VS Code or similar program. You must have Python 3 installed to run this program. 

## Usage

In the integrated terminal, run `python order_system.py` or `python3 order_system.py` to start the app. From there, follow the instructions as directed. If invalid input is supplied, the progam is set up to automatically handle these cases and gently nudge you in the right direction.
